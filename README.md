Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This Java application implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Java Swing library for the graphical user interface. The game is designed for two players: 
Player X and Player O, who take turns to mark the cells in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 
wins the game. If all cells are filled without any player aligning three marks, the game ends in a tie.
 

Features
- Graphical Interface**: The game window is built using `JFrame`, `JPanel`, and `JButton` components, providing a clean and interactive GUI.
- Dynamic Gameplay: Players alternate turns, with the current player's turn indicated at the top of the window.
- Win Detection: The game checks for win conditions after each turn, highlighting the winning combination when a player wins.
- Tie Detection: If all nine tiles are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
- Simple Design**: The game uses a minimalistic design with dark gray and orange colors, providing a modern look.

 To run the game, compile the Java source file and run the `Main` class. Enjoy a fun game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend!
